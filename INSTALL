INSTALL for Seq64-tests v 0.9.9.5
Chris Ahlstrom
2015-10-06 to 2015-10-06

The current packaging for Seq64-tests is aimed at developers.
There is currently no configure script... it must be bootstrapped.

Steps:

   0.  Preload any DEPENDENCIES, as listed at the end of this document.
       However, if some are missing, the configure script will tell you,
       or, at worst, a buld error will tell you.

   1.  Check-out the branch you want.  Make a branch if you want to make
       changes.

   2. From the top project directory, run the commands:

      $ ./bootstrap
      $ ./configure

      For debugging without libtool getting in the way, just run the
      following command, which will add the --enable-debug and
      --disable-shared options to a configure run:

      $ ./bootstrap --enable-debug

   3. Run the make command:

      $ make

      If you do not care about the documentation and debian packaging,
      change to the various sub-project directories before running make.

   4. To install, ... Well, this project is for testing, not installation.

CONFIGURE OPTIONS FOR TEST FEATURES:

    --disable-lash

        Undefines the SEQ64_LASH_SUPPORT macro, which is otherwise defined
        by default.

    --disable-jack
    
        Undefines the SEQ64_JACK_SUPPORT macro, which is otherwise defined
        by default.

    --disable-jack-session

        Undefines the SEQ64_JACK_SUPPORT macro, which is defined if JACK
        support is defined, and the jack/session.h file is found.

DEPENDENCIES:

   With luck, the following dependencies will bring in their own
   dependencies when installed.

   Code:

      -  libgtkmm-2.4-dev (dev is the header-file package)
      -  libsigc++-2.0-dev
      -  libjack-jackd2-dev
      -  liblash-compat-dev (optional)
      -  xpccut++ and xpccut libraries installed from the xpcutxx project

   Build tools:

      -  automake and autoconf
      -  autoconf-archive
      -  g++
      -  make
      -  libtool
