The seq64-tests project provides testing for the libraries used
in the Sequencer64 project.

We can do some manual testing, but it is too easy to miss
something.

This package is oriented to developers.  Please see the
INSTALL file for a brief description of installation.

Usage:

    The usage of this test project requires building a debug version
    of the sequencer64 project, building and installing the xpccutxx
    project, and building and running the seq64-tests project.
    All projects are found at https://github.com/ahlstromcj.
    All project should be cloned to the same base directory; currently
    seq64-tests expects to find the sequencer64 at the same directory level.

    sequencer64:

        $ ./bootstrap --enable-debug  (sets up project and runs ./configure)
        $ make

    xpccutxx:

        $ ./bootstrap
        $ ./configure
        $ make
        $ make check (and verify that both libraries passed their tests)
        # make install

    seq64-tests:

        $ ./bootstrap --enable-debug
        $ make

        Find the executable libseq64_unit_test in libseq64/src, and run it.

Later, we may have more than one unit-test executable.  Not sure yet.
