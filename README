The seq64-tests project provides testing for the libraries used
in the Sequencer64 project.

We can do some manual testing, but it is too easy to miss
something.

This package is oriented to developers.  Please see the
INSTALL file for a brief description of installation.

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=4 et ft=sh
